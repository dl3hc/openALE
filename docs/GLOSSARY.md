# PC-ALE 2.0 - Glossary of Terms

Comprehensive terminology reference for Automatic Link Establishment and related standards.

---

## ALE Terminology

### **2G ALE** (Second Generation ALE)
MIL-STD-188-141B Appendix A protocol. Uses 8-FSK modulation at 125 baud for automatic link establishment on HF radio. Provides robust calling, scanning, and channel selection.

### **3G ALE** (Third Generation ALE)
MIL-STD-188-141C protocol. Enhanced version with higher data rates (up to 8000 bps), better LQA, and advanced features. Not yet implemented in PC-ALE 2.0.

### **ALE** (Automatic Link Establishment)
Protocol for automatically establishing HF radio links without operator intervention. Handles frequency selection, calling, handshaking, and channel quality assessment.

### **AllCall**
Broadcast call to all stations monitoring ALE channels. Uses wildcard addressing (e.g., `***`) to reach any listening station.

### **AMD** (Auto Message Display)
Short message (up to 90 characters) transmitted during ALE call. Displayed automatically on receiving station. Used for tactical messaging.

### **AQC-ALE** (Advanced Quick Call ALE)
MIL-STD-188-141B Appendix C enhancements. Adds data elements (DE fields), CRC protection, slotted responses, and transaction codes to 2G ALE.

### **ASCII-64**
64-character subset of ASCII used in ALE words. Includes A-Z, 0-9, space, and 27 special characters. Encoded in 6 bits.

## ARQ Terminology

### **ACK** (Acknowledgment)
Positive acknowledgment that data was received correctly. In FS-1052, sent as ACK bitmap indicating which blocks were received.

### **ARQ** (Automatic Repeat Request)
Error control method where receiver requests retransmission of corrupted data. FS-1052 uses selective repeat ARQ.

### **Broadcast ARQ**
One-way ARQ mode (FED-STD-1052). Transmitter sends data without waiting for acknowledgments. Used for point-to-multipoint.

### **Circuit ARQ**
Bidirectional ARQ mode (FED-STD-1052). Both stations can send data simultaneously. Not implemented in PC-ALE 2.0.

### **Fixed ARQ**
FED-STD-1052 mode with fixed block size (128 bytes). Simpler than Variable ARQ but less efficient. Not implemented in PC-ALE 2.0.

### **FS-1052** (FED-STD-1052)
Federal Standard 1052: HF Radio Data Link Protocol. Defines ARQ modes, frame formats, and error recovery for HF data transmission.

### **NAK** (Negative Acknowledgment)
Indicates data was received with errors. In selective repeat ARQ, NAK bitmap specifies which blocks need retransmission.

### **Selective Repeat ARQ**
ARQ mode where only corrupted blocks are retransmitted. Uses bitmap to track which blocks were received correctly. Most efficient ARQ mode.

### **Variable ARQ**
FED-STD-1052 mode with variable block size (1-1023 bytes). Adaptive to channel conditions. Fully implemented in PC-ALE 2.0 Phase 5.

## Modulation and Coding

### **8-FSK** (8-tone Frequency Shift Keying)
Modulation used in 2G ALE. Eight tones spaced 125 Hz apart (750-1750 Hz) encode 3 bits per symbol. Symbol rate is 125 baud.

### **BER** (Bit Error Rate)
Percentage of bits received incorrectly. Used to measure channel quality. Lower BER indicates better quality.

### **Baud**
Symbol rate (symbols per second). For 8-FSK at 125 baud, 3 bits per symbol = 375 bps.

### **CRC** (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
Error detection code appended to data. PC-ALE uses:
- CRC-8 (AQC-ALE): Polynomial 0x07
- CRC-16 (AQC-ALE): Polynomial 0x1021 (CCITT)
- CRC-32 (FS-1052): Polynomial 0x04C11DB7 (FED-STD-1003A)

### **FEC** (Forward Error Correction)
Error correction added before transmission. 2G ALE uses Golay (24,12) code with 3-bit error correction capability.

### **FFT** (Fast Fourier Transform)
Algorithm for frequency analysis. Used in PC-ALE demodulator to detect which of 8 tones is present.

### **Golay (24,12) Code**
FEC code encoding 12 data bits into 24-bit codeword. Can correct up to 3 bit errors. Used in 2G ALE for robust transmission.

### **SNR** (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
Ratio of signal power to noise power (in dB). Higher SNR indicates better signal quality. Used in LQA calculation.

---

## Protocol Terminology

### **Channel**
Radio frequency used for communication. ALE scans multiple channels to find best one. Each channel has associated LQA.

### **Data Element (DE)**
Field in AQC-ALE word containing additional information:
- DE1: Reserved
- DE2: Slot position (0-7)
- DE3: Traffic class (0-15)
- DE4: LQA (0-31)
- DE5-DE8: Reserved
- DE9: Transaction code (0-7)

### **Dwell Time**
Time spent listening on each channel during scanning. Default is 200ms. Shorter dwell = faster scanning but more missed calls.

### **Handshake**
Exchange of messages establishing a link:
1. Caller sends TO + FROM + TIS
2. Called station responds with TIS
3. Caller confirms with TWAS

### **LQA** (Link Quality Analysis)
Measurement of channel quality (0-31 scale). Based on SNR and BER. Stored per-channel to guide frequency selection.

### **Net**
Group of stations sharing common address. Net calls reach all members. Example: `NET1` includes `ALPHA`, `BRAVO`, `CHARLIE`.

### **Preamble**
3-bit field in ALE word indicating word type:
- `000` = DATA
- `001` = THRU
- `010` = TO
- `011` = FROM
- `100` = TIS (This Is)
- `101` = TWAS (This Was)
- `110` = CMD
- `111` = REP

### **Scanning**
Process of listening to multiple channels sequentially. ALE scanner dwells on each channel, looking for calls.

### **Sounding**
Transmission of TIS words on multiple channels to measure channel quality. Allows stations to build LQA table.

### **TIS** (This Is)
ALE word identifying a station. Used in handshakes and soundings. Contains station address.

### **TWAS** (This Was)
ALE word confirming link establishment. Sent by caller after receiving TIS from called station.

### **Wildcard Address**
Address pattern using `*` (match any characters) or `?` (match single character). Example: `ALF*` matches `ALFA`, `ALFRED`, `ALFONSO`.

---

## State Machine Terminology

### **CALLING State**
State machine state where station is transmitting a call (TO + FROM + TIS sequence). Waiting for TIS response.

### **HANDSHAKE State**
State where station is responding to incoming call with TIS. Will transition to LINKED if caller sends TWAS.

### **IDLE State**
Initial state. Not scanning or calling. Waiting for command.

### **LINKED State**
State where link is established. Can send AMD or transition to data mode. Link quality is known.

### **RECEIVING State**
State where station is processing incoming ALE words. Parsing word sequence to determine action.

### **SCANNING State**
State where station is scanning channels. Listening for calls on each frequency in channel list.

### **Retransmission Queue**
List of blocks that failed to send or were NAKed. Blocks in queue are retransmitted.

### **Selective Reject**
ARQ mechanism where receiver NAKs specific blocks (not entire window). More efficient than go-back-N.

### **Sequence Number**
8-bit identifier for each data block (0-255). Wraps around after 255. Used to detect duplicates and order blocks.

### **Sliding Window**
Flow control mechanism. Sender can have up to window_size blocks outstanding. Default window size is 16.

### **T1 Frame**
FS-1052 control frame: Link setup request. Contains source/destination addresses and mode.

### **T2 Frame**
FS-1052 control frame: Link setup confirmation. Acknowledges T1 and confirms link.

### **T3 Frame**

### **Window Size**
Maximum number of unacknowledged blocks allowed in flight. Larger windows improve throughput but require more memory.

## Implementation Terminology

### **Callback**
Function pointer registered with PC-ALE libraries. Called when events occur (word received, link established, data received).
